# Cryptography
## Mod 26
I used ROT13 online decoder for this. ROT13 is same as Caesar Cipher but replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. 
## The Numbers
Decimal to string online converter can be used for this task. 
## 13
Same ROT13 method is used to solve this task.
## caesar
Caesar Cipher online decoding tool can be used to decode the given string. As we dont know the key to decrypt, it is better to keep it as "guess" and the online tool will search for the meaningful string as well as returns the key.
